# ThorsHighSchoolDays

This is a capture of lots programs I wrote during high school from 1977 to 1979.   
I went to Sandia High in Albuquerque, NM.  I also went to the Career Enrichment Center (CEC) which was an advanced classroom center.

The CEC housed a DEC KA-10 running TOPS-10.   MITS (Paul Allen and Bill Gates) rented time on this machine--they were also in Albuquerque during some of this period.

Most of this is just PDF scans (kudos to the CZUR scanner I just bought -- it rocks).   I may try to OCR and ressurect some of this code on a TOPS-10 emulator later.
Digital versions of these did not survive until modern times, so I've kept the paper, in hopes of a good scan/ocr pair.   Getting there with CZUR.

The printer at the school didn't have lower case, though some of this is dot matrix output.  I will also likely include some stuff I didn't write.  I'll put such things in the notes.
