# PROIMP.MAC

In my (very uniquely named) high school Sandia High School (https://sandia.aps.edu/), in the late 70s, we had a modem connection to the KA-10 mainframe (http://gunkies.org/wiki/KA10) which was downtown at the CEC (Career Enrichment Center).   We had an LA-36 printer terminal (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/la36.html), and a card reader.   We also had a pair of card punch machines (older than one in the picture here: https://twobithistory.org/2018/06/23/ibm-029-card-punch.html).    Students in the FORTRAN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) and BASIC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) class would type in their programs and we'd (my friends and I that were in the advanced class) run the deck on the card reader and give them a listing and their output.  The computer science teacher during my time at Sandia was Marianne Holder.

This is a program that I wrote to clean up the data (calls PIP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program) utility to remove trailing spaces and such) to make it easier to run (and make it much smaller), and much faster to list out (since it didn't block everything out to 80 columns of spaces).

This program was written in Macro-10/36 assembler (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACRO-10), of yore (and many references in the Jargon File (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File) document).
