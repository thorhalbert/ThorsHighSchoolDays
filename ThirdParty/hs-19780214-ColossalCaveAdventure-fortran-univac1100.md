# Colossal Cave Adventure for the Univac 1100 in Fortran

I was given this printout sometime in 78 or 79 by one of the admins at the CEC.   We had an original version of the PDP-10 version of Advent, though they'd almost never let us play since it was such a giant resource hog.  The KA at CEC was not a very big machine, so games were rather limitted.

I was told that this was printed out by one of the creators of the game and much more recently did some research, and found that this was certainly not the case.
But, I did discover who did print it, and there's an interesting story there.   

So, this does appear to be generally the augmented 350 point version of the game.   
It has some specialty assembler for Univac 1100 (coincidenally another 36 bit mainframe) in it and comments in several places trying to get around bugs in the univac fortran compiler.

However, sleuthing data on the basic printout, this was printed out by Frank Wancho who worked at the White Sands Missle Range (WSMR) -- in southern New Mexico.
Frank turns out to have been quite an active member of our community.  He was a curator for the simtel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simtel) open source library.
Frank died in 2015.

I'm not really sure how this doc managed to get where it did (and I've had it in various boxes for 42 years).   It seem like Frank did some effort porting it and getting it to run (though his name's not on it anywhere--and the univac assemblyer was done by others).

Another Colossal Cave story I have is when I was at New Mexico Tech (in Socorro), friends were modifying the source to advent here to add adventures representing the steam tunnels under Workman Center - and elsewhere on the campus, which seemed quite extensive in '79.
