# PROIMP.MAC

In my (very uniquely named) high school Sandia High School (https://sandia.aps.edu/), in the late 70s, we had a modem connection to the KA-10 mainframe which was downtown at the CEC (Career Enrichment Center).   We had an LA-36 printer terminal (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/la36.html), and a card reader.   We also had a pair of card punch machines (older than one in the picture here: https://twobithistory.org/2018/06/23/ibm-029-card-punch.html).    Students in the fortran and basic class would type in their programs and we'd (my friends and I that were in the advanced class) run the deck on the card reader and give them their output.

This program that I wrote clean up the data (calls PIP utility to remove trailing spaces and such) to make it easier to run (and make it much smaller).
